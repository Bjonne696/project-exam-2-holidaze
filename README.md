Holidaze is an innovative accommodation booking site designed to facilitate easy and efficient booking experiences for customers, and venue management for accommodation providers. This React application integrates with the Holidaze API to provide a seamless front-end user experience for booking holidays and managing accommodation listings.

## Description

The Holidaze application was developed as part of a project exam to showcase the culmination of skills learned in web development. The application features two main interfaces: a customer-facing site for booking accommodations and an admin-facing side for venue management. Key functionalities include:

- Viewing a list of available venues
- Searching for venues based on criteria
- Detailed venue pages with availability calendars
- User registration and login, with different roles for customers and venue managers
- Venue management for registered venue managers, including the ability to create, update, and delete listings
- Booking management for registered customers
